# Photography and captions for Journalists
Make your stories come to life.

**A picture is worth a thousand words.**

We humans are visual creatures. Seeing something helps us understand it better. And because of that, photos are a fantastic way to convey a point in your story. A good photo conveys tone, emotion, scale, and mood. When done well, a photo can say things your story never could.

## What makes for a good photo?

### 1. Proximity
The absolute number one thing that can make for a good news photo is proximity. More than lighting, more than editing, more than framing. Get close.

Example: [The Life and Times of Strider Wolf](https://apps.bostonglobe.com/graphics/2015/11/strider/)

This is a story about the life of a boy in Maine who has lived through a lot. His mother's boyfriend nearly beat him to death with he was two. He was placed with his grandparents by the state. His grandparents were evicted from their mobile home, leaving them with just a camper and each other. And through it all, Strider is just looking for love.

Take a look at the photos. Look at the one of the boys in the car. How close do you think the photographer had to be to get that shot? Look at the one of Strider carrying the water jugs. Again, how close do you think the photographer was?

Proximity is the one thing you can't fake in photography. You can change lighting in photoshop, you can crop framing, but you can't fake getting close to your subject. (And no, not even if you use a zoom. Zoom lets you make the image bigger, but it doesn't bring the reader closer in. If you want to zoom, zoom with your feet.)

(P.S.: these photos won the 2016 Pulitzer prize in photography)

### 2. Perspective
We're used to seeing things from our everyday perspectives: 4-7 feet in the air and 10-15 feet away from the action. You can make your photos interesting by breaking that perspective. 

- Shoot closer to the ground. 
- Shoot from behind the subject's shoulder, to show what they're looking at.
- Stand on a chair and shoot from above.

Here's an example from a [story I worked on a long time ago](https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20121207/hudson-heights/storefront-science-workshops-let-children-learn-through-exploration/). On a basic level, the story's not that amazing: it's kids learning about science by playing. Some of these even have terrible lighting. But the best ones are interesting because they're shot from the level of the children, showing what they're looking at. We (the readers) learn with the kids.

### 3. Patience
This might be the biggest key to it all. Getting close to someone awkward. It's going to feel awkward. I know it, believe me. I've been there. The key to getting past it is to be patient. Get your camera out and take as many photos as you can. Eventually the subject will get used to your presence and they'll relax. When that happens, you can get something great.

Here's a great example. A photographer from the Wall Street Journal was in the White House for an everyday press session with President Trump. And as he's shooting, he looks around and sees the White House Chief of Staff and Communications Director nearby. It's been in the news lately that they hate each other. So he starts snapping photos of them and he winds up with one where they appear to be staring each other down. [The photo goes viral immediately](http://time.com/4877327/anthony-scaramucci-reince-priebus-photograph/).

That photo doesn't happen if the photographer is focused on President Trump or if he's in a hurry to get his shots. He took his time, looked around and was patient. And because of that he wound up taking an iconic photograph.

Be that photographer. Don't rush through your photographs. Don't treat them like an afterthought. Take as many as you can. Explore different angles. Try different lighting conditions.  Be patient.

## Tips for shooting with phones
You don't need an expensive DSLR to take great photos. The phone you have in your pocket can get the job done. And to help you out, here are a couple of tips.

1. Turn on the rule of thirds: The rule of thirds is a photography technique that helps you compose naturally interesting photos. It imposes a 3x3 grid on your screen. If you can put the subject along one or two of those lines, you'll end up with a decent photo.  ([You can learn more about it here](https://www.photographymad.com/pages/view/rule-of-thirds))
	- To turn it on using an iPhone, go to Settings > Camera > Grid and hit the toggle.
	- (Sorry Android users, there are too many different camera apps to give you one solid tool.)

2. Keep your subject lit: Phone cameras don't do well in low light. They produce grainy photographs. So pay attention to where your light source is and try to make sure you shoot so that the light is on your subject. Use flash if you need to.
3. Don't use the zoom: Zoom on mobile phones just makes pixels look bigger and photos look grainier. If there is a detail you want to shoot, GET CLOSER.

### A note on posing
- Don't tell your subject to pose. In news photography we want to capture subjects as they are naturally. Readers expect that what they're seeing is what actually happened. (This also means don't use the portrait mode. That's an artificial effect.)

## Captions
If the photograph helps tell the story, the captions help make sure everyone is caught up. They exist to both explain to the reader what they're looking at and why they're looking at it.

Here's an example from [The City](https://thecity.nyc/2019/04/public-funding-of-private-school-security-rises-by-millions.html).

The story is about private school security being funded by public money. The photo's a building. It might not make sense until you read the caption, which tells us:

  - Who or what we're looking at.
  - When this took place
  - Where it is
  - Why it's important

(Look at that! The five Ws in one sentence.)

Here's a recent example: Tiger Woods won the Masters yesterday. [Here's how the NY Times captioned it](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/sports/tiger-woods-wins-masters.html).

Again, who, what, when, and why.

Try to make sure your captions do this. If you're showing us people, tell us who they are or what they're doing, and then explain why we're seeing this. If you're showing a building, explain what it is, where it's located, and explain why it's important.
